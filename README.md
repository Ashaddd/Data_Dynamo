Problem Statement: After graduation, colleges often lose connection with 
alumni due to scattered records and poor communication channels. This limits 
mentorship opportunities and community growth.

Description: Design a smart alumni web-based platform where former students 
can register, update their profiles, and stay connected with the college. It should 
showcase notable alumni, enable event announcements, and provide a search 
function for mentorship opportunities. This strengthens alumni bonds and helps 
current students grow through shared knowledge.
